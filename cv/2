What is image processing?
Tasks and methods where input and output are images (тензоры)
Goals:
I. Improve image for human perception
2. Improve image for automatic recognition
3. Extracting features for further analysis
4. Conversion for technical needs
5. Entertainment (special effects)


Image histogram
Image values don't fully use available luminance range or concentrate around certain values

- Autocontrast
Point operator: pixel output value is defined only by it's own value, i.e. all pixels are processed independently. Simplest case is linear correction:
(x) = (x - Xmin)

- Stable autocontrast
To make autocontrast more stable to noise, drop 5% of min and max values to compute Xmin and xmax

- How make contrast correction for color images?

- Nonlinear contrast correction
f(x) = c*x^T

- Correcting with neutral card
Take a photo of white or gray card under desired illumination
Multiply RGB values by 1/r, 1/g, and 1/b
What drawbacks does this method have?

Gray world assumption: average per-channel value should be equal for all three channels,/Compute multipliers rw, gw, bw, that correct image according to this assumption


- Noise
Gaussian noise
Data drop-out noise:
• Salt-and-pepper: random black and white pixels
• Impulse noise: random white pixels

image averaging - ЦПТ


Image convolution - операция свертывания 

filters:
fast box
separbale
gaussin filter with a box filter
fast median
